## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) Short name of the Tenant resource.
- `parent` (String) The parent id for the Tenant resource.

### Optional

- `description` (String) A description of the resource.
- `display_name` (String) User friendly name for the resource.
- `security_domain` (String) Security domains can be used to group different resources under the same security domain. Although security domain is not resource itself currently, it follows a fqn format `organizations/myorg/securitydomains/mysecuritydomain`, and a child cannot override any ancestor's security domain. Once a security domain is assigned to a _Tenant_, all the children resources will belong to that security domain in the same way a _Workspace_ belongs to a _Tenant_, a _Workspace_ will also belong to the security domain assigned to the _Tenant_. Security domains can also be used to define _Security settings Authorization rules_ in which you can allow or deny request from or to a security domain.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Fully-qualified name of the Tenant resource.
